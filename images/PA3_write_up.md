stogram of cluster sizes is dominated by a few large clusters, with some small ones, indicating a few flow durations account for most activity. The network visualization shows central hubs and some overlaps between clusters, with several regions that appear fragmented. The summary statistics reveal that longer flow durations tend to have higher mean Total Length of Fwd Packets, while shorter durations show lower means, highlighting a link between flow duration and forward payload size.
